# Progress Log

What's actually been done, in order. Update this after finishing a chunk of
work — not just at the end of a session. See `roadmap.md` for what's left
and `decisions.md` for why things were done a certain way.

## Status by phase

| Phase | Status |
|---|---|
| 1 — Foundation (key gen/exchange, safety number) | Complete — key exchange + safety number screen working end-to-end |
| 2 — Encrypted messaging (relay + real-time text) | Not started |
| 3 — Encrypted voice messages | Not started |
| 4 — UI polish | Not started |
| 5 — Marketing/landing site | Not started |

## Log

- **2026-07-18** — Project scaffolding: created `AGENTS.md`, `roadmap.md`,
  `decisions.md`, `progress.md`. Connected local repo to GitHub remote
  (`juanmendoza-dev/Trojan-Troy`). No app code written yet.

- **2026-07-18** — Phase 1 complete: room-code pairing relay (`/server`),
  React client with libsodium.js key exchange and safety-number screen
  (`/client`). Verified end-to-end with two browser windows landing on a
  matching safety number. See
  `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-18-phase1-foundation.md`.
